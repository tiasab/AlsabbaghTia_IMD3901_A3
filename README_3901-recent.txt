Overview of what you did?
This is one of the projects in which I am highly confident. What I made was inspired by a game that my friends and I used to play when we were young, and which I still remember well. During the tutorial, I heard Mr.Anthony express that he likes suggests it to be a sketching game, which sparked the idea. Basically, two users access the 2D mode and begin the game with separate usernames, and the users must draw an object and the other player must guess it, that the player can guess through the game's chat. I used the libraries game.js, internal.js, log.js, and utils.js.
The game's 3D mode displays what is drawn in both rooms; however, three tabs must be opened when playing or testing. Two individuals will be required to launch the 2D mode.

What was challenging?
The most difficult part was when I got really excited and began adding more to the code so that there would be a win or a loss, but the entire thing crashed a few hours before submission, so I chose not to go over the scope and keep it simple while still matching the rubric attached. It took me a while to figure out how the chat system worked until I went through a few things that helped me get through it.

What went well ?
When the game turned out to be what I imagined it would be in my head, naming the variables, using app.get for the first time as well as learning the chat system in JS.
